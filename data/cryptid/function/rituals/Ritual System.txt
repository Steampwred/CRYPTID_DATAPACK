------------------------< Ritual System Process >------------------------

Each ritual consists of 3 main parts:  The Orifice, The Alter,  and The Offerings. 
for more advanced &/or stable rituals, The Summoning Circle and Modifier Blocks are required. 

 
The Orifice 
    Entity that stores data, and origin where ritual commands are executed from 


The Alter 
    Unique block structure built at the center under the orifice. Serves as a key that tells the orifice which Ritual type is selected. 
    Ritual Type is stored and later referenced through a macro to provide the corresponding reward function 


The Offerings 
    Placed blocks, dropped items, and mobs within the range of the ritual when activated become offerings. this is how the orifice detects material components for an induvial ritual type. 
    When preforming a ritual, you need the required offerings for it to be successful. This is used mainly in crafting or upgrading cryptid items 
    Technically the Alter is a placed block offering although, these blocks are typically not consumed as they only serve to select a Ritual Type. 



The Summoning Circle 
    The "floor" which the ritual takes place on. A physical block design that if present tells the Orifice that the ritual is organized and less severe mishaps can occur 
    If present Orifice will check 8 points spaced 45 degrees each. These are the Modifier slots. 


Modifier Slots 
    Modifier Slots and the associated Modifier Blocks allow players a few customization options for a ritual. Essentially these are futureproofing for whenever we want to add new mechanics to rituals. 

Modifier Blocks and their effects:

- Lodestone, focus block that takes another material block (Occult focus) place on top of the lodestone. The Occult Foci increase or decrease the probability of success, but, are consumable. Up to 5 lodestones can be used at max. 

- Enchanting table, adds the translate tag to the orifice. This provides additional information throughout the duration of a ritual intended to help players learn how to use the system and, fix misplaced blocks. 

 

 

File organisation structure 

When calculating a ritual, its done in phases, each phase and its respective functions are ordered first to last in the order they are called in the tickorifice function. 


In function/rituals folder as such in order

    Anthame             (The Ritual Knife, used to summon the orifice and Initiate a Ritual)

    Initial             (Inital checks that store data about the selected ritual and its modifiers)

    Random              (Calculation and final check phase)

    Result              (Handles the various Outputs, succeses and failures along with individual ritual rewards)

 

Notes
- alter and circle check are defined in predicates
- orifice code is located outside /rituals, it is under cryptid/function/tick/tickorifice.mcfunction
